		<p style="font-size:125%"> Ever wanted to follow the process of a mediocre collegiate runner?! Now is your chance! Though I may only go to a small NAIA school, I still aspire to one day become a professional athlete. However, I have a lot of work left to get there. On this blog, I will be logging my runs daily, including any news with races or other events, and sharing any news I find interesting in the running community. </p>

	<h2>USA Outdoor Track & Field Championships</h2>
	<p style="font-size:150%"> Over this past weekend, the Outdoor Championships for professional Track & Field athletes in the USA took place. Of all the great performances that occured, the one that stood out for me was Nick Symmonds performance in the 800m. At age 31, Symmonds has won his 6th National Title. The most impressive part of his win is the facto of where he was one year ago: on his couch, contemplating retiring. After suffering a devastating injury, Symmonds thought he may never compete again. But with the help of <a href="http://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/athletes/brooks-beasts-track-club">Brooks Running</a> and his new-found company <a href="http://getrungum.com/">Run Gum</a>, a new fire has ignited inside of Symmonds. I personally admire Nick for overcoming his negative thoughts and for perservering. A lot of people may have thought he was done after just missing the podium at the Olympics in 2012, but now he has proven otherwise. Symmonds will be competing next at the IAAF World Championships in Beijing. Along with him, Alysia Montano won the Women's 800m in an impressive time of 1:59.15. Montano's crazy story? At this same time one year ago, she was 8 months pregnant. As if that wasn't crazy enough, Montano even competed last year at the Outdoor Championships while she was pregnant! Cudos to Alysia. To read the full article on Symmonds, click <a href="http://registerguard.com/rg/sports/33243210-81/nick-symmonds-takes-mens-800-title-at-usa-track--field-championships.html.csp">here</a>. <br><br> Also, congratulation to Oregon Ducks' Jenna Prandini for winning the Women's 200m in 22.20 and to Oregon Project's Galen Rupp for claiming his 7<sup>th</sup> consecutive win  10000m and getting 3<sup>rd</sup> in the men's 5000m, qualifying in both events for the IAAF World Championships. </p>
