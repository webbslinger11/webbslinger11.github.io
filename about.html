        <p> I was born in Roseville, CA to parents Jennie Bender and Daniel Webb. At the age of 2 my mom and I moved to where I still currently reside: beautiful Southern Oregon. Though initially we moved to Medford, Grants Pass became the town I will forever call home. </p>

        <p> All of my high school years were thankfully spent at the rural Hidden Valley High School just on the outskirts of Grants Pass. It was during these years that I discovered many of the passions in my life including running, music, and - oddly enough - math. After getting cut from the basketball team, I joined the Track team simply because I wanted to participate in some sort of athletics; little did I anticipate what it would blossom in to. It was also here that I helped form my first band with my best friends. We were called <i>Reigning Umbrellas</i> and although we never made it to the "big time" it was our small group that sparked my love for playing music. Of all the experiences I have had in my life, none of them have been like playing music in front of a live audience. Like most teenagers attending high school, I didn't particluarly like the "school" aspect of it, but of all the subjects, I had quite a predilection for math. As I advanced through the levels of algebra and calculus, gaining the acceptance from the Math Gods each step I took, I soon realized that whatever career path I chose, I wanted it to heavily involve math. <br> <br> I graduated Hidden Valley in 2013 and was a co-Valedictorian of my class - alongside Morgan Hansen. Throughout High School, I flirted around with many different groups and clubs, including Mock Trial, Poetry Out Loud, Mathletes, Academic Challenge, Academic Masters, Swim Team, and was not to mention Vice-President of our National Honor Society. Though I had fun with many of these organizations, none of them were as dear to me as running or music; those were things that I held as my priorities, along with my friends, grades, and family. I left Hidden Valley having established many great friends and memories along with the discovery of my interests, ready to move on and puruse my future career. </p>

        <p> Music was an interest of mine at an early age. My father played guitar and I believe it was watching him jam on his old fender strat on warm summer nights that influenced my desire to play. On my 9<sup>th</sup>birthday I finally got my first guitar - that I still have and play to this day. It was a simple black fender acoustic guitar; not the most prestine guitar ever but certainly a step above the average "beginner's" guitar. </p>
